# MLflow Tracking Server Security

## Protect Your ML Infrastructure with Built-in Security Features

MLflow 3.5.0+ includes comprehensive security middleware to protect your tracking server against common web vulnerabilities. These features work automatically for localhost development while providing full configurability for production deployments.

:::important Version Requirement
Security middleware features require **MLflow 3.5.0 or later**. Earlier versions do not include these protections.
:::

## Quick Start: Secure Your Server

Getting started with MLflow server security is straightforward. The default configuration provides strong security for local development, while production deployments can be configured with just a few environment variables or command-line options. Choose the configuration below that matches your deployment scenario:

<TabsWrapper>
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="development" label="Local Development" default>

```bash
# Development is secure by default - just run:
mlflow server

# Server automatically:
# ✅ Accepts localhost connections only
# ✅ Allows CORS from any localhost origin
# ✅ Protects against DNS rebinding attacks
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="team" label="Team Server">

```bash
# Configure for internal team access
mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --allowed-hosts "mlflow.internal:5000" \
  --cors-allowed-origins "https://notebook.internal,https://dashboard.internal"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="production" label="Production">

```bash
# Production with specific allowed applications
export MLFLOW_ALLOWED_HOSTS="mlflow.company.com"
export MLFLOW_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://app.company.com,https://jupyter.company.com"
export MLFLOW_X_FRAME_OPTIONS="SAMEORIGIN"

mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1  # Behind reverse proxy
```

## Security Features Overview

MLflow's security middleware provides multiple layers of protection against common web vulnerabilities. These features work together to create a comprehensive security framework that adapts to your deployment needs. Each protection mechanism is designed to be non-intrusive for legitimate users while effectively blocking potential attacks:

## Common Use Cases

### Remote Python SDK Access

```python
import mlflow

# Connect to remote MLflow server
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://mlflow.company.com:5000")

# SDK automatically handles Host headers
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_param("alpha", 0.5)
    mlflow.log_metric("rmse", 0.1)
```

The Python SDK works seamlessly with security features - no special configuration needed for SDK-only access.

### Jupyter Notebook Integration

MLflow traces automatically display as embedded iframes in notebooks:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://mlflow.company.com:5000")

# This will display an interactive UI in the notebook
trace = mlflow.get_trace("your-trace-id")
```

For cross-origin notebooks, see the [UI Access Guide](/ml/tracking/server/security/ui-access).

### Dashboard Embedding

```html
<!-- Embed MLflow UI in your dashboard -->
<iframe src="http://mlflow.internal:5000"
        style="width: 100%; height: 800px;">
</iframe>
```

Requires proper [X-Frame-Options configuration](/ml/tracking/server/security/configuration#iframe-embedding-configuration).

## Security at a Glance

| Feature              | Default (Localhost)           | Production Recommendation    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Host Validation**  | Allows localhost, private IPs | Configure specific domains   |
| **CORS Origins**     | Any localhost origin          | Explicit application origins |
| **iframe Embedding** | SAMEORIGIN                    | SAMEORIGIN or CSP headers    |
| **Security Headers** | Always enabled                | Keep enabled                 |
