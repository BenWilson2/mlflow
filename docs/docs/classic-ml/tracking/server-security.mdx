# MLflow Tracking Server Security

:::important Version Requirement
The security middleware features described in this guide are available in **MLflow 3.5.0 and above only**.
If you're using an earlier version, you'll need to implement your own security measures via reverse proxy or upgrade to MLflow 3.5.0+.
:::

Starting from version 3.5.0, MLflow includes built-in security middleware that protects your tracking server against common web vulnerabilities. This guide explains the security features, how to configure them, and best practices for deployment.

## Why Security Middleware?

MLflow tracking servers are often exposed to networks beyond localhost, making them potential targets for various attacks. The security middleware provides protection against:

- **DNS Rebinding Attacks**: Prevents attackers from tricking browsers into accessing internal services
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Attacks**: Blocks unauthorized cross-origin requests that could steal data
- **Host Header Injection**: Prevents attacks that manipulate the Host header for cache poisoning or password reset attacks
- **Clickjacking**: Prevents embedding MLflow UI in malicious iframes
- **MIME Type Confusion**: Blocks browsers from incorrectly interpreting file types

## Default Security Behavior

By default, MLflow server is configured for **secure local and internal network development**:

- Accepts connections from localhost addresses (127.0.0.1, ::1, localhost) on any port, and private IP ranges (192.168._, 10._, 172.16-172.31.\*)
- Allows cross-origin requests from any localhost port (e.g., http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:8080, etc.)
- Validates Host headers to prevent DNS rebinding attacks
- Adds security headers to all responses (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Blocks cross-origin state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) from non-localhost origins unless explicitly configured

This means you can run `mlflow server` on your local machine or internal network without any configuration, and team members can access it from private IP addresses.

## Configuration Options

Security can be configured via CLI options or environment variables. CLI options take precedence over environment variables.

### Security Configuration

| CLI Option               | Environment Variable            | Description                                  | Default                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `--cors-allowed-origins` | `MLFLOW_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`   | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins | localhost on any port         |
| `--allowed-hosts`        | `MLFLOW_ALLOWED_HOSTS`          | Comma-separated list of allowed Host headers | localhost + private IP ranges |
| `--no-host-validation`   | `MLFLOW_HOST_HEADER_VALIDATION` | Disable Host header validation               | Validation enabled            |
| `--allow-insecure-cors`  | `MLFLOW_ALLOW_INSECURE_CORS`    | Allow ALL origins (DANGEROUS!)               | Disabled                      |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Using CLI options
mlflow server --allowed-hosts "mlflow.company.com,10.0.0.100:5000" \
              --cors-allowed-origins "https://app.company.com"

# Using environment variables
export MLFLOW_ALLOWED_HOSTS="mlflow.company.com,10.0.0.100:5000"
export MLFLOW_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://app.company.com"
mlflow server
```

## Understanding --host vs --allowed-hosts

These two options serve completely different purposes:

- **`--host`**: Controls which network interface the server binds to (networking configuration)
  - `127.0.0.1` = Only accessible from the same machine
  - `0.0.0.0` = Accessible from any network interface

- **`--allowed-hosts`**: Controls which Host headers are accepted (security configuration)
  - Prevents DNS rebinding attacks
  - Validates the Host header in incoming requests
  - Has nothing to do with network binding

Example: You might run `mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --allowed-hosts mlflow.company.com` to:

- Bind to all network interfaces (accept connections from anywhere)
- But only accept requests with `Host: mlflow.company.com` header

## Common Deployment Scenarios

### 1. Local Development (Default)

No configuration needed - just run:

```bash
mlflow server
```

The server will:

- Accept connections from localhost and private IP ranges
- Allow CORS from any localhost origin (http://localhost:_, http://127.0.0.1:_, http://[::1]:\*)
- Be protected against external attacks

### 2. Team Development Server

For a shared development server on your internal network:

```bash
# Option 1: Using CLI options
mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --allowed-hosts "dev-server:5000,192.168.1.100:5000" \
  --cors-allowed-origins "http://dev-server:5000,http://192.168.1.100:5000"

# Option 2: Using environment variables
export MLFLOW_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://dev-server:5000,http://192.168.1.100:5000"
export MLFLOW_ALLOWED_HOSTS="dev-server:5000,192.168.1.100:5000"
mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0
```

### 3. Production with Specific Applications

For production with known client applications:

```bash
# Only allow your specific applications
mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000 \
  --allowed-hosts "mlflow.company.com" \
  --cors-allowed-origins "https://ml-dashboard.company.com,https://notebook.company.com"

# Or use environment variables for configuration management
export MLFLOW_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://ml-dashboard.company.com,https://notebook.company.com"
export MLFLOW_ALLOWED_HOSTS="mlflow.company.com"
mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```

### 4. Behind a Reverse Proxy (nginx/Apache)

If your reverse proxy handles security:

```bash
# Disable MLflow's security (proxy handles it)
export MLFLOW_HOST_HEADER_VALIDATION="false"
export MLFLOW_ALLOW_INSECURE_CORS="true"

# Only bind to localhost since proxy handles external connections
mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1
```

Example nginx configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name mlflow.company.com;

    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";

    # CORS configuration
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://app.company.com";

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

### 5. Development with Insecure CORS (⚠️ WARNING)

**NEVER use this in production!** Only for local development:

```bash
# Allows ALL origins - extremely dangerous!
export MLFLOW_ALLOW_INSECURE_CORS="true"

mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0
```

## Troubleshooting Access Issues

### "403 Invalid Host header" Error

**Symptom**: Clients receive a 403 error with "Invalid Host header - possible DNS rebinding attack detected"

**Solution**: Add the hostname to allowed hosts:

```bash
export MLFLOW_ALLOWED_HOSTS="mlflow.company.com,10.0.0.5:5000"
```

### "403 Cross-origin request blocked" Error

**Symptom**: Web applications can't access the API, receiving "Cross-origin request blocked"

**Solution**: Add the application's origin:

```bash
export MLFLOW_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://notebook.company.com,https://app.company.com"
```

### Preflight OPTIONS Requests Failing

**Symptom**: Browser's preflight requests fail for CORS

**Solution**: Ensure the origin is in allowed origins and the server accepts OPTIONS requests:

```bash
export MLFLOW_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourapp.com"
```

### Local Network Access Issues

**Symptom**: Can't access from other machines on local network

**Solution**: The server automatically allows private IP addresses. Ensure you're binding to all interfaces:

```bash
mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Always Use HTTPS in Production

MLflow server doesn't handle HTTPS directly. Use a reverse proxy:

- nginx, Apache, or Caddy for HTTPS termination
- Cloud load balancers (AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer)
- Kubernetes ingress controllers

### 2. Explicitly Configure Allowed Origins

Don't rely on defaults in production:

```bash
# Good - explicit configuration
export MLFLOW_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://app1.company.com,https://app2.company.com"

# Bad - using insecure mode
export MLFLOW_ALLOW_INSECURE_CORS="true"  # Never in production!
```

### 3. Use Specific Hostnames

Be specific about allowed hosts:

```bash
# Good - specific hosts
export MLFLOW_ALLOWED_HOSTS="mlflow.company.com,mlflow.internal.company.com:5000"

# Bad - disabling validation
export MLFLOW_HOST_HEADER_VALIDATION="false"  # Avoid unless necessary
```

### 4. Regular Security Updates

Keep MLflow updated to get the latest security patches:

```bash
# Ensure you have at least version 3.5.0 for security middleware
pip install --upgrade "mlflow>=3.5.0"
```

### 5. Monitor Access Logs

Enable debug logging to monitor security blocks:

```bash
mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --dev  # Enables debug logging
```

### 6. Principle of Least Privilege

Only allow the minimum necessary access:

- Restrict CORS origins to known applications
- Limit allowed hosts to your domain
- Use authentication (MLflow auth or reverse proxy auth)

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to MLflow 3.5.0+

If you're upgrading from an older version (pre-3.5.0):

1. **Local Development**: No changes needed - security is transparent for localhost

2. **Production Servers**: You may need to configure allowed origins:

   ```bash
   # If you have web apps accessing MLflow:
   export MLFLOW_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourapp.com"

   # If accessed via custom domain:
   export MLFLOW_ALLOWED_HOSTS="mlflow.yourdomain.com"
   ```

3. **Behind Reverse Proxy**: If your proxy handles security, disable MLflow's:
   ```bash
   export MLFLOW_HOST_HEADER_VALIDATION="false"
   export MLFLOW_ALLOW_INSECURE_CORS="true"
   ```

### Testing Your Configuration

Test your security configuration:

1. **Test Host validation**:

   ```bash
   # Should fail with 403
   curl -H "Host: evil.com" http://your-mlflow-server:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/search
   ```

2. **Test CORS protection**:

   ```bash
   # Should fail with 403 for state-changing requests from non-allowed origins
   curl -X POST -H "Origin: http://evil.com" \
        http://your-mlflow-server:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/create
   ```

3. **Test from allowed origin**:

   ```bash
   # Should succeed
   curl -H "Origin: https://yourapp.com" \
        http://your-mlflow-server:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/search
   ```

   Note: Security applies to all API versions (2.0, 3.0, and future versions) at `/api/*` endpoints.

## Disabling Security (Not Recommended)

If you have your own security layer and need to disable MLflow's:

```bash
# Disable all security checks
export MLFLOW_HOST_HEADER_VALIDATION="false"
export MLFLOW_ALLOW_INSECURE_CORS="true"

# Only bind to localhost if behind proxy
mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Only disable security if you have alternative protections in place!

## Implementation Details

MLflow uses industry-standard middleware libraries for security:

- **Flask Backend**:
  - [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/) for CORS protection with regex patterns
  - Custom host validation using fnmatch for wildcard pattern matching
  - Active CORS blocking for state-changing requests to API endpoints
  - Automatic allowlisting of private IP ranges per RFC 1918 (192.168._, 10._, 172.16-31.\*)

- **FastAPI Backend**:
  - Native [Starlette CORSMiddleware](https://www.starlette.io/middleware/) for cross-origin protection
  - Custom host validation middleware supporting wildcard patterns (like Flask)
  - Custom lightweight middleware for security headers and CORS blocking
  - Consistent behavior with Flask implementation

- **Shared Security Logic**:
  - Centralized security utilities prevent code duplication
  - API endpoints (all `/api/*` paths) receive special CORS handling
  - OPTIONS preflight requests return 204 No Content for API endpoints
  - Localhost origins are automatically allowed on any port

This approach leverages well-tested, battle-hardened libraries rather than reinventing security mechanisms. Both backends provide consistent security features while using framework-appropriate implementations.

## Security Headers Added

MLflow automatically adds these security headers to all responses:

| Header                             | Value        | Purpose                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| `X-Content-Type-Options`           | `nosniff`    | Prevents MIME type sniffing |
| `X-Frame-Options`                  | `SAMEORIGIN` | Prevents clickjacking       |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`      | (varies)     | Controls CORS access        |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` | `true`       | Allows credentials in CORS  |
| `Vary`                             | `Origin`     | Prevents cache poisoning    |
